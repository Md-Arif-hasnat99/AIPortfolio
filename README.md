2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy your API key

### 2. Configure the API Key

1. Open `config.js` in your project
2. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual Gemini API key:

```javascript
const GEMINI_CONFIG = {
    API_KEY: 'your-actual-api-key-here', // Replace this line
    // ... rest of config
};
```

### 3. Run the Portfolio

#### Option 1: Live Server (Recommended)
1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click on `index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

#### Option 2: Local HTTP Server
```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
